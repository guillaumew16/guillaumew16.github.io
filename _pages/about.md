I am a 4th-year PhD student in Mathematics at EPFL, advised by [Prof. Lénaïc Chizat](https://lchizat.github.io/).

I'm broadly interested in theory for machine learning, particularly if it explains what machine learning models "actually" do. 
The tools I've found most useful for this, so far, come from optimization (convex and non-convex) and optimal transport.

Before that I was a research intern at the [Statistical Machine Learning](https://sml.inf.ethz.ch/) group at ETH Zurich.
Before that I was a Master student in Computer Science at ETH.
Before that I was a student at Ecole polytechnique.

**Note:** to lift any confusion, I am *not* the famous cellist of the same name. I have never touched a cello in my life.
