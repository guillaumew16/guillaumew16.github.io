For this blog post, I decided to try out another publishing framework: [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/).
I have to say it's quite a bit more convenient for math blogging than the other things I've tried, so I will probably be using it for future posts as well.

The blog post is split into two parts, the first one is accessible [here](https://guillaumew16.quarto.pub/blog/posts/hypocoercivity1/): 
[https://guillaumew16.quarto.pub/blog/posts/hypocoercivity1/](https://guillaumew16.quarto.pub/blog/posts/hypocoercivity1/).
The second one is [here](https://guillaumew16.quarto.pub/blog/posts/hypocoercivity2/).
